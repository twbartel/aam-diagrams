# aam-diagrams

These are two standalone HTML files that demonstrate two diagram types presented 
in Daniel S. Vacanti's book [Actionable Agile Metrics for Predictability](https://leanpub.com/actionableagilemetrics).

- cumulative-flow-diagram.html draws a cumulative flow diagram (CFD) based on random data.
- scatterplot.html draws a cycle time scatterplot with some percentile lines, also based on random data. 

Both files use [nvd3.js](http://nvd3.org/) and [d3.js](https://d3js.org/). The 
source code can be used in whatever way you wish.
